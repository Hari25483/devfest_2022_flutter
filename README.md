# devfest_2022_flutter

The basic project for Flutter State Management code-labs in GDG DevFest Sri Lanka 2022.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for the code-labs.

### Basic step.

Project uses Flutter Version Manager (FVM) to manage the Flutter version. 
You can use it or a latest version of Flutter would be fine.

The project will use minimal external dependencies possible.

If you are using VSCode project will recommend some extension to be installed which I used while creating the project. It's optional apart from Dart and Flutter extensions.

## Code-lab topics.

- Basic state management.
- Provider.
- Riverpod.
